This is a project of a Taverna Workbench's plugin. 
The main purpose of this plugin is adding a new saving logic feature and modifing the user interface of Taverna Workbench to use this feature.
Specifically this plugin allows you to save a workflow in an online database by adding it to an existing dataset in a dataverse repository. This operation is done thruogh the use of SSHOC dataverse tool.
SSHOC dataverse tool is a web service that provides support to comunicate with Dataverse.
Dataverse is an open source web application to store and manage research data (repository).

Currently to use this functionality with Taverna Workbench it is necessary to download the source code compiling it with java and run Taverna.
The functionality that will make it a downloadable plugin will be implemented soon.
